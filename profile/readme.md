## A blockchain for launching sovereign blockchains

## History

The project started in May 2020 with the mission to improve the developer experience of Cosmos by creating an easy-to-use CLI tool for developers to build new Cosmos SDK blockchains and tutorials to help new developers get started.

The CLI was inspired by Ruby on Rails code scaffolding functionality, Vue CLI tooling and the Cosmos scaffold tool.

On July 27, 2020, the first version [was released](https://medium.com/tendermint/starport-the-easiest-way-to-start-building-a-blockchain-8ecc016573d0).

In August, 2020, the idea of building a blockchain for coordinating launches of new sovereign blockcahins was proposed.

On December 21, 2020, a proof of concept for the blockchain was demoed at Interchain conversations conference.

On March 21, 2021, the CLI was used during the IBC launch party.
